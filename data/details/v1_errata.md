## Errors Found

Building the augmented Tycho-2 catalog and matching it to HIPPARCOS and HD IDs turned up a few erroneous cross-reference IDs in the various sources used to make the cross-references.

### HYG

HYG v3.4 was the original source of data for AT-HYG v1.0. A few errors were found and incorporated into HYG v3.5, the authoritative source for matching HYG to AT records.

According to SIMBAD, the following HIP IDs do not have a corresponding HD ID, and the originally-assigned HD IDs have been removed, in HYG v3.5:

* HIP 27111
* HIP 29395
* HIP 30997
* HIP 70790
* HIP 73094
* HIP 86405
* HIP 86542
* HIP 97991
* HIP 100111
* HIP 107156

Also according to SIMBAD, the following HIP IDs were assigned an incorrect HD ID, and have been updated accordingly in HYG v3.5:

* HIP 16747: correct ID is HD 22159
* HIP 18443: correct ID is HD 286368
* HIP 18759: correct ID is HD 281458
* HIP 20065: correct ID is HD 283549
* HIP 20272: correct ID is HD 27369
* HIP 21983: correct ID is HD 286996
* HIP 23728: correct ID is HD 32839
* HIP 24368: correct ID is HD 241842
* HIP 26280: correct ID is HD 288089
* HIP 29889: correct ID is HD 291456
* HIP 46395: correct ID is HD 302225
* HIP 48835: correct ID is HD 86523
* HIP 54355: correct ID is HD 96600
* HIP 77945: correct ID is HD 327627
* HIP 88762: correct ID is HD 312644
* HIP 90265: correct ID is HD 336196
* HIP 94106: correct ID is HD 234817
* HIP 96490: correct ID is HD 350185
* HIP 98255: correct ID is HD 350851
* HIP 100848: correct ID is HD 346569
